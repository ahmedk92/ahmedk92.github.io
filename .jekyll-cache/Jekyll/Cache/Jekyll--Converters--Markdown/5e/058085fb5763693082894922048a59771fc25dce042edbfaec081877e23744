I"N<p>While you can make your app support multiple languages, still there’s no easy (and documented) way to dynamically change the app’s localisation. You either let the user choose the iOS device’s language; and your app just follows along. Or you can use that <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/1669645/715593">AppleLanguages solution</a>. But if you want the change somewhere after the app has started (i.e. not in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">main</code> function), you have to close the app, and wait for the user to open it again. Which is not the best we can expect.</p>

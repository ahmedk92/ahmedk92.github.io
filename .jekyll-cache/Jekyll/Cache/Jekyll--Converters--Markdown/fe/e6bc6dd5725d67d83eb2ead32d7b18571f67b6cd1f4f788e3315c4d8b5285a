<p>We use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Xcode/Reference/xcode_ref-Asset_Catalog_Format/index.html">Asset Catalog</a> to store images we use inside our apps. If youâ€™re not using it, you should. Itâ€™s not just a fancy way to organize our resources. It also does some optimizations we happen to overlook them.</p>
